Problem Statement:“Inspect and debug webhooks in real time — without localhost headaches.”

Approach:
V1-   user must create an unique endpoint, response headers and body to be stored against the endpoint, 
      data to be retrieved on frontend.
*never reject the request. accept any header, any http method, any body and respond fast

Scenarios:
*10 webhooks in 1 sec= just ingest and respond fast
*payload not json=just ingest and store as text
*user refreshes dashboard=polling

Data model:
endpoint=unique id , token which is used as string,creation time
request= method, header, body, received at , endpoint_id

 

Setup :-
Server folder:  npm init -y
                 npm install -D typescript tsx @types/node
                 npm install express
                 npm install -D @types/express
                 npm install -D nodemon       
                 npx tsc --init          
                 npm install prisma --save-dev
                 npm install @prisma/client  
                 npx prisma init      

*make changes in tsconfig file and package.json files 
*then use npx prisma db pull to  check if db connection is secured .
*make migrations using npx prisma migrate dev --name init

*now creating routes and controllers for endpoint and responses

for Endpoints:
* get request to fetch all the endpoints present in db--> easy

* post request to create an endpoint. use crypt library inbuilt in node js to make token which are unique.
give 5 tries max to create it , so there are no conflicts for token.  use baseurl64 and 24 random bytes to make it into string. baseurl64 so that it does contain - and _   .

for WebHooks:
